> **APPLICATION OVERVIEW**

The aim of this application is to help users who studying at univerisity of Milano Bicocca 
with a system that manages the repetitions between students who attend the same faculty. 
So the idea behind this application is to create a network of trust between users/students,
giving the opportunity for some student to share their knowledge and to find an economic 
indipendence. It can be also the opportunity for student who wants to start a course in our
university to prepare the entry test.

There are two types of users:
1) Users searching for repetitions;
2) Users who delivers repetitions.

Each user with the process of subscription at the application define his role and the
subject who wants to learn or to explain. After this, users who are matched could organize 
a meeting. In our idea, the university could create spaces where these meetings take place.
Next, the user who received the repetitions can return feedback through the application and
organize a new meeting. 
Furthermore, the user who has provided the repetitions can also send a positive or negative 
comment on the student for the next "teacher".
